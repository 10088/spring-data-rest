# Spring Data Web Exporter

The goal of the project is to provide a flexible and configurable mechanism for writing simple services that can be exposed over HTTP.

The first exporter implemented is a JPA Repository exporter. This takes your JPA repositories and front-ends them with HTTP, allowing you full CRUD capability over your entities, to include managing associations.
