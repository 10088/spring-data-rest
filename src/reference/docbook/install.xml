  <title>Installing Spring Data REST</title>

  <section>
    <title>Adding Spring Data REST to an existing Spring MVC application</title>

    <para>Spring Data REST is itself a Spring MVC application and is designed in such a way that it should integrate
      with your existing Spring MVC applications with very little effort. An existing (or future) layer of services can
      run alongside Spring Data REST with only minor considerations.
    </para>

    <para>To install Spring Data REST alongside your application, simply add the required dependencies, include the
      stock
      <code>@Configuration</code>
      class (or subclass it and perform any required manual configuration), and map some URLs to be managed by Spring
      Data REST.
